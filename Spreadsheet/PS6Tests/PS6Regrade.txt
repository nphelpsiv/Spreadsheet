Hey Boya thank you for doing the regrade. Notice I made 3 simple changes to pass all but a few test cases.
The changes have been commented which you can find by searching for "//Change".
For the first change I simpy had to add another conditional to
check now only if name was null but also it was valid. Ffor the second change I had to
get the spreadsheet contents in this case rather than values "spreadsheet[s].GetContents().GetType().Equals(typeof(Formula))".
For my third change I added a try catch to a catch if the key, or name wasn't found. This
exception was being thrown because of my implementation on one dictionary rather than two
I also added a if else conditional to my tryparse to make sure I was gettting a double.
Thank you for the regrade, hopefully you can find all the changes. If you have any questions just let me know. 
Also for the changes Future issues can be avoided
by adding more test cases on my end, especially corner cases. Thank you for regrading this
project.
